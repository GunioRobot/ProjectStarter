Welcome to the ProjectStarter repository

ProjectStarter is a simple, opinionated CLi program to help you create an initial directory structure
for your .NET C# projects. It will create a new directory with the name you pass to it containing a src, tests lib, and bin directories. 
Initially it will create a build.proj file and README as well. 
You can then customize the build.proj file to specify your projects name, the output type, and any references you need.

Why start with an MSBuild file instead of a Visual Studio solution? You can always create a new VS solution later if you prefer. By creating an MSBuild file first you are instantly set up to use a continuous integration server and can use any IDE you'd like.
